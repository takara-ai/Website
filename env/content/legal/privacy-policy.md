Welcome to Takara.ai ("we", "us", "our"), an AI consultancy dedicated to showcasing our services through our website. Your privacy is critically important to us, and this Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we collect and record, how it's used, and how we safeguard your data.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### Personal Data

We collect personal data through our contact form, such as your name and email address. This data is necessary for us to communicate with you, respond to your inquiries, and facilitate the provision of our services should you wish to engage with us.

### Analytics and Tracking Data

We use GoatCounter for analytics and tracking to understand how our website is used and to improve our marketing efforts. GoatCounter is designed to be privacy-friendly, collecting data without personally identifying individual users.

## 2. Data Handling

### Third-Party Services

The personal data collected through our contact form is processed by Formspree and then sent to our ProtonMail account. Analytics data is handled by GoatCounter. Both services are selected for their commitment to privacy and security.

### Data Storage and Security

We do not directly store your personal data on our systems. Instead, it is stored on the secure servers of the third-party services we use. We ensure that these services comply with high privacy and security standards, but we encourage you to review their privacy policies for more details.

## 3. User Rights

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK data protection laws, you have rights over your personal data, including the right to access, correct, or delete your information. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us using the email address provided at the end of this policy.

## 4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on our website and hold certain information. These are used for enhancing your experience and improving our website's functionality and marketing efforts.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. Your continued use of our service after any modifications to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
