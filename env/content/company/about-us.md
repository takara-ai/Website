> **Takara means treasure.**

Welcome to [takara.ai](/), where we harness artificial intelligence not merely as a technological marvel but as a transformative force for businesses and humanity. Founded in 2024, our consultancy is committed to unlocking AI's vast potential, empowering individuals and organizations to excel in an increasingly competitive landscape.

### The Challenge: Mastering AI Implementation

The inception of takara.ai was inspired by a clear market gap: the intrigue surrounding AI's promise versus the reality of its implementation. We noticed businesses grappling with questions about AI integration: selecting the right models, integrating AI seamlessly into operations, and identifying the starting point for their AI journey.

Recognising this, takara.ai set out to be the compass that guides business leaders through the intricate landscape of artificial intelligence, offering clarity and direction in a complex field.

### The Origami Crane: A Symbol of Peace, Longevity and Good Fortune

> I think Logo's are so important, they must have meaning and they must be recognisable. I spent a long time deciding what I wanted people to see and think... "That's TAKARA!" the origami crane has so much history, it's folded from nothing and becomes something and I wanted to relate to humanity since it's very easy to get lost in making everything look very modern and tech heavy. I engaged with Kiana at [IDAZA](https://www.idaza.io/) and she brought it to life how you see it today. I couldn't be happier. - Jordan Legg
