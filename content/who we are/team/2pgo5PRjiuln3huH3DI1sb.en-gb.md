funBio: "Jordan, based in Northampton, is a passionate DJ, rock climber, and classic car enthusiast who enjoys photography using vintage lenses. He has a deep love for house music and is also highly engaged in computer vision. At home, Jordan runs a personal data center where he tests the latest AI models, humorously claiming he’s \"coming after AWS, one rack at a time.\" He shares his life with three dogs—Charlie, Molly, and Byron—and considers himself fortunate to have traveled to over 30 countries. If he weren't in IT, Jordan imagines he’d be welding exhaust pipes at Redcrane Engineering in Milton Keynes. He even once drove from Northampton to the top of Denmark, a personal \"Top Gear\" adventure."
