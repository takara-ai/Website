When milliseconds matter, DS1 wins.

### **The Challenge**

Mainstream embedding APIs are too slow, expensive, and lack data residency for regulated, latency-critical industries—especially when every millisecond counts for fraud detection, recommendations, search, or live analytics.



- **Speed That Delights:** Milliseconds matter—DS1’s <20ms latency is unrivalled, enhancing user interactions.
- **Radical Cost Efficiency:** Reduce embedding-related infrastructure costs by over 50% compared to transformer models.
- **Flexible Data Control:** Keep data where you need it—with both cloud and on-premise deployments.
- **Always Improving:** Our model-agnostic approach ensures ongoing access to the best in static embedding technology, future-proofing your AI stack.

- **Model Agnostic**: Our innovative architecture allows us to continuously integrate the best static models as they emerge
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Available as SaaS or for on-premise/VPC deployment to meet security and compliance requirements
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple integration with standard OpenAI-compatible API calls—swap it in with minimal code changes
- **Cost Effective**: Pay significantly less for embeddings without sacrificing quality

### **Use Cases**

**Semantic Search**
Build semantic search that ranks content by meaning and similarity - not just keyword match - using DS1’s static embeddings for robust, low-latency retrieval.

**Recommendation Systems**  
Create content, product, or service recommendations based on similarity and preference signals - delivering personalised results while keeping infrastructure costs low.

**Data Classification & Organization**  
Automatically cluster, categorize, and organise unstructured data (documents, messages, etc.) with speed and efficiency -especially when combined with a high-performance vector database.

**Regulatory Compliance & Analysis**  
For environments with strict data governance, DS1’s on-premise option powers AI-driven analysis and discovery - without your data ever leaving secure infrastructure.
