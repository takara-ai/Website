Transform your AI vision into reality with this intensive full-day workshop designed specifically for organisations ready to take their first steps in AI implementation. Limited to 12 decision-makers and innovation leaders, this workshop guides you from concept to concrete action plan. 

Starting with your identified use cases, we assess your organisation&#39;s AI readiness and implementation capabilities. Through interactive sessions, participants master essential AI concepts crucial for their first AI solution. We explore how to structure an effective Proof of Concept and identify potential barriers to production deployment. The workshop emphasises responsible AI practices and governance frameworks to ensure sustainable, ethical deployment.

You&#39;ll leave with a practical, actionable roadmap aligned with your organisation&#39;s unique context, resources, and objectives. This workshop bridges the gap between AI ambition and successful execution, equipping you with the knowledge and framework to begin your AI journey with confidence and clarity.

# Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, participants will have a clear, actionable implementation plan tailored to their organisation&#39;s AI use case. They&#39;ll understand the key components required for successful AI deployment, including technical infrastructure, skills requirements, and governance considerations. Participants will be equipped to evaluate their organisation&#39;s AI readiness, identify potential barriers to implementation, and understand the steps needed for a successful proof of concept. Most importantly, they&#39;ll leave with a practical roadmap that outlines the journey from initial development to production deployment, including resource requirements, timeline considerations, and critical success factors. This concrete framework enables organisations to move forward with confidence in their AI implementation journey.

# Audience

This workshop is ideal for senior business leaders, technology decision-makers, and innovation leads who have identified AI opportunities within their organisation but need clarity on implementation. Perfect for those who understand AI&#39;s potential but haven&#39;t yet begun their implementation journey, it serves executives and managers who need to bridge the gap between strategic vision and practical execution. While technical expertise isn&#39;t required, participants should have decision-making authority or significant influence over their organisation&#39;s technology strategy and resource allocation. The workshop is particularly valuable for organisations that have concrete use cases in mind but lack the experience to move from concept to implementation, making it especially relevant for non-tech industries starting their AI journey.
