If you haven’t noticed, Takara.ai is a Japanese-inspired company, and our logo is an origami crane.

As something fun to do, here are some step-by-step instructions on how you can make your very own origami crane!

### A Brief History

The origami crane is one of the most iconic symbols in Japanese culture, representing peace, longevity, and good fortune. Traditionally, it’s believed that folding 1,000 cranes, known as "senbazuru," grants the maker a wish. This practice became especially poignant after World War II, symbolizing the hope for peace in a world that had seen much conflict. At Takara.ai, the crane embodies our aspirations for innovation and harmony in the digital world.

## What You'll Need

- A square sheet of paper (preferably origami paper, but any square paper will do)
- A flat surface to work on
- Patience and a steady hand

## Display Ideas

Your crane doesn’t have to sit alone on a shelf. Here are some creative ways to showcase your paper art:

- String multiple cranes together to create a unique garland
- Attach them to wooden skewers for festive drink decorations or cake toppers
- Hang them from a decorative branch for a whimsical mobile
- Use them as place card holders for a dinner party

Remember, the joy of origami lies not just in the final product, but in the meditative process of folding. Each crane you make will be unique, carrying with it the energy and intention you put into its creation.
