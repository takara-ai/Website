## Accessibility and Inclusive Design Considerations

**Instruction Following Prompt Guide:**

```markdown
"Incorporate accessibility and inclusive design considerations into the prototyping process for [PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION] by following these steps:

1. Conduct research to identify the [NUMBER_OF_KEY_ACCESSIBILITY_NEEDS] key accessibility needs of the target users, considering factors such as [ACCESSIBILITY_FACTORS].

2. Review and adhere to established accessibility guidelines, such as [ACCESSIBILITY_GUIDELINES], throughout the design process.

3. Design the user interface with accessibility in mind, focusing on [ACCESSIBILITY_FOCUS_AREAS] such as color contrast, font legibility, and intuitive navigation.

4. Conduct accessibility testing with [NUMBER_OF_USERS] users with different abilities, using tools like [ACCESSIBILITY_TESTING_TOOLS].

5. Iterate on the prototype based on the accessibility testing results, making necessary improvements to ensure an inclusive user experience.

Provide details for each step to guide the process of incorporating accessibility and inclusive design considerations into the prototyping process for [PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION]."
