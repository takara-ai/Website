I&#39;m thrilled to announce the release of **WorldScenario 20K**, a novel and state-of-the-art dataset featuring over 20,000 multi-stakeholder scenarios designed to simulate real-world decision-making processes. 

Each scenario addresses a unique environmental, societal, or economic challenge, making it a rich resource for training and fine-tuning AI models.

This dataset is tailored for fine-tuning and extended pretraining of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to provide more holistic and nuanced answers in complex situations. By considering the motivations of multiple stakeholders, these models can offer recommendations that go beyond one-dimensional solutions.

For example, in a case where a farmer is losing crops to global warming, an AI like ChatGPT might currently suggest basic advice, such as switching to resilient crops. 

However, with WorldScenario 20K, the responses become far more rounded and realistic—highlighting pros and cons, addressing the perspectives of other stakeholders, and proposing multi-dimensional solutions that are more effective in a complex and interconnected world.

I believe that releasing this dataset will empower AI models to assist people in more meaningful and impactful ways across a variety of challenges. 

Thank you for your support—I can’t wait to see how this contributes to advancing AI for the greater good!
