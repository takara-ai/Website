I&#39;m over the moon to annouce CineDiffusion, an application designed to produce high quality images in modern and vintage cinema widescreen aspect ratio&#39;s.

I made this because I LOVE classic movies with those huge wide shots and anamorphic lenses, I&#39;m inspired by Taxi Driver, Lawrence of Arabia, Leon the Professional and more in these examples below.
