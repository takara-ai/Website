## 2. Data Handling

### Data Security
We deploy systems entirely on Amazon Web Services (AWS), adhering to the AWS Well-Architected Framework and AWS security best practices. Our security measures include:
 - Implementation of AWS's robust security controls, including Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Security Groups, and Network Access Control Lists
 - Use of AES-256 encryption for data at rest via AWS's native encryption services
 - Data in transit protection through TLS/SSL encryption
 - AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) with role-based access controls and the principle of least privilege
 - Multi-factor authentication for all administrative access
 - Regular security assessments and audits of our AWS architecture
 - Real-time monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail
 - Automated security patching and updates for all infrastructure components
 - Regular backups with versioning to prevent data loss
 - For client-provided AI training data, we implement additional segregation controls through separate AWS accounts or isolated environments

We retain different types of data for specific periods:
 - Transaction Data: Retained for 7 years to comply with financial regulations.

## 4. Client Data Processing
As an AI consulting firm, we often act as a data processor on behalf of our clients. In such cases:
 - Processing Agreement: We enter into a formal data processing agreement that details the scope, purpose, and duration of processing.
 - Data Minimization: We work with clients to ensure only necessary data is provided for AI development.
 - Anonymization and Pseudonymization: Where appropriate, we implement anonymization or pseudonymization techniques to protect individual privacy when processing data for AI model training.
 - Specialized Handling: Client data used for AI training is segregated from other data and subject to enhanced security controls.
 - Return or Deletion: Upon project completion, client data is either returned or deleted according to the terms of our agreement, unless retention is required for model maintenance or agreed upon in writing.
