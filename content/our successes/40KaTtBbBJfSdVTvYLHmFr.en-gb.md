        value: "Using Takara’s AI Pathfinder approach and leveraging AWS Bedrock and the Nova LLM, Takara's team implemented the client's High-Level Design (HLD) process. By integrating a comprehensive knowledge base of existing HLDs with cutting-edge AI, we created a solution that not only generates innovative game designs but also validated the entire rationale for the use of AI. The intuitive user interface, built with AWS Amplify, put this powerful capability directly in the hands of users, allowing them to experiment and successfully close out the Proof of Concept within 4 weeks, giving the go ahead to move to production."
