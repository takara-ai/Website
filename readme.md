# Development

## Conventional Commits Specification:

1. **Structure**: Each commit message consists of a header, a body, and a footer. The header has a mandatory type, an optional scope, and a required description:

   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <description>

   [optional body]

   [optional footer(s)]
   ```

2. **Type**: This describes the kind of change that the commit is introducing. Common types include:

   - `feat`: Introduces a new feature.
   - `fix`: Patches a bug.
   - `chore`: Other changes that don't modify `src` or `test` files.
   - `docs`: Adds or alters documentation.
   - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
   - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
   - `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
   - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
   - `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
   - `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).

3. **Scope**: An optional part of the format that provides additional contextual information, like the module or component affected by the change.

4. **Description**: A brief, imperative mood description of the change:

   - Use the present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
   - No dot (.) at the end.

5. **Body**: An optional longer description of the change. It should provide a meaningful commit message, which:

   - Explains the context of the change.
   - Describes the impact and the rationale behind the change.
   - Can contain multiple paragraphs and bullet points.

6. **Footer**: Optional. Used for referencing issue tracker IDs, pull request numbers, etc. Examples:
   - `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` for introducing breaking changes.
   - `Closes #123, #456` for listing related issues or pull requests.

### Benefits of Conventional Commits:

- **Automatic Versioning and Changelog Generation**: Tools like semantic-release can use these standardized messages to determine version bumps and generate changelogs.
- **Improved Readability**: Makes the commit history easier to read and understand.
- **Facilitates Team Communication**: Ensures that all team members follow a consistent commit style.

### Example Commit Message:

```
feat(authentication): implement JWT based auth system

The new authentication system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage user sessions securely. This change includes necessary updates to the user model and database schema.

Closes #42
```
